i think i want to be a part of this north west rap thing

it has been probably going hard for many years
but it recently hit me hard
i know it will continue to hit hard in the  future, but for me this was the initial hit




boxd

two background options: the one i use, the one i think looks and becomes communitive; initially, but every one can make and choose their own

mine is just the code
my interpretation is just animated and colord

seeing others with your own design or all mine or theirs, or some collection of these

you can choose someone elses for your own
they can pay to hide their code, and still, if its for sale you can pay them
 
[]:link to that box, if you click on it the box moves above and highlights the quote expanding enough to grant context

code boxes:
syntax highlighting
per each language
qim and emacs hacks
my base, a collective form, and their additions;

socially and private boxes:
option to save locally or on server, present the pros and cons of each
pay for local, explaining the extra downloading, and the lack of privacy and advertising model
local is plain text object notation;

one script to run it locally you choose the option of browser 
also add option to run along side it the code

d is me
c is the sans sin
b is any box
a is any box


behind boxes have a conky like screen done with javascript

calculator box:
processes the values before a ';'
starts indented
'                   .. 2 + 17;'
'19'





aene:
you can break up or divide the world into twos or threes or any and that any is always infinite
but every one can make and choose their own[boxd]
"do one of three things"
but in those three are infinites, two options become infinite when you factor in chaos:
often misunderstood as hyper randomising
is actually control of something other than yourself
in all ways:
you assuming control of another
their control of you
their control of each other
               ;;into the option for choosing
and with one infinity as as many it ts all one infinity
and one infinity itself is simply aene;







why do you give your money away?
this is all by design,
the least of my worries is to hold on to this,
i know i can do it all again,
because i made this by design,
without risk, or manipulation,
asking questions then finding thaer answer,
and on,
the questions are fleeting, but flight is our one true dream,
those who promote their dreams change the math of it all,
it is what we love
