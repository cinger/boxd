search daily show and colbert for clips:
+sqlite3 database:
  -easily forms into relational
  -r1c1 timestamp of performance
+link to that clip on dailyshow website
(could post clip but would be too dangerous for takedown because viacom is notorious for dmca)
+make naive transcripts from speech to text software:
  -https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6203805
  -dragon natural speaking software
+allow users to add tags or quotes
+search first my work, then display, then search user generated, display:
  -perhaps show top three of both and option to drop down the rest of the results?
results can show transcript as well

formatting box:
-t "reformat" --subs --example "MARK>MARK:MARK)MARK#MARK;" -mark "'1':'      MARK','2':'...^MARK'"
-t "reformat" --standard --example "===MARK" -mark "'1':'MARK\nLEN-'"

LEN will fill out the following character the length of the box, have to add on resize a resize confirm variable that will say the window has been resized and thenif the format box is focused it will go through the box contents and redetermine box character length and change all the LEN lines of that box by taking a store of the old box length value and checking each line if the all characters of that line are equal to the LEN character then if so truncating the rest or adding the new
will only be done to format boxes, on focus, and only LEN reformats


on resize:
  --if % is less than 16px than check the css file for all instances of that percentage and reattribute the value to 16px;
