subs/make ::

  in an attempt to simplify regular expressions for everyone, i broke down the expression into three parts, the opening, the string, and the close,
  that said it is very plausible to just put your own completely unique, conjoined regex into the string position, leaving the abstracted open and close undefined

   ] -t "string replace" -s "(^|(\w*))(no|not|never)(?=\W+)" -r "ni!"
